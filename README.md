# java_crud_with_react

Full stack app to make a JUGS (Java User Groups) tour.

Front end uses React
Backend uses Java Spring Boot
Authentication handled by Okta who also provided the tutorial.

Had to improvise due to several errors in tutorial docs but software dev is mostly troubleshooting anyway.
I commented the solutions in the code for anyone who happens to come across this.
